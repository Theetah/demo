                        A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any
                        ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against a
                        blinded creature have advantage. A blinded creature can
                        attack creatures with a blind attack if they are aware of
                        them.

                        they have, a creature with this condition takes damage to
                        their hit points equal to half their healing rate (rounded
                        down). A dying creature with any levels of this condition
                        fails a death save at the start of their turns. If a creature
                        who has any levels of bleeding is healed, they do not gain
                        any hit points, instead they remove two levels of bleeding.

                        When a creature becomes unconscious, it drops anything
                        it was holding and all of its stamina points drop to 0. It
                        can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.

                        While wasted, you gain the effects of buzzed, drunk, and
                        hammered. Additionally, you remember nothing from the
                        time while you're wasted and you fall unconscious after an
                        hour.
