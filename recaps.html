                        Following the events of their introduction to North Mill,
                        the party goes to leave in their respective vehicles,
                        but finds all of their cars (except for Dante's) sabotaged
                        in an odd way: most are filled with some sort of slime! <br><br>

                        Meanwhile, Rico follows a trail of blood from the street
                        into the forest, find a severed hand. He discovers a watch
                        engraved with the letters "NMPO" on it, later being revealed
                        to mean North Mill Police Officer; it appeared to have
                        belonged to one Luke Meadows, a Traffic Cop officer. <br><br>

                        Following this discovery, a visit to the police station
                        reveals that this Luke Meadows is seemingly well and alive,
                        to the mundane surprise of everyone. <br><br>

                        With a critical success on a seemingly random Spot Hidden
                        check, Rico spots one of the police officers tampering with
                        a nearby motorcycle. Later inspection reveals a small amount
                        of damage from an odd oozing substance. <br><br>

                        The next morning, James wakes up early on a walk to find
                        a good place to eat. He find a nice cafe to eat breakfast
                        by himself at and then circles back around to meet Rico
                        near yesterday's crime scene near O'Galliger's.
                        With a critical success on a Spot Hidden check, Rico
                        literally sniffs out a site of hooded figures burning
                        corpses from a van out in the woods. He goes to tell
                        James about how there were a few well-armed guards
                        there as well. <br><br>

                        Later, the entire gang gets together in order to
                        investigate the now abandoned and smouldering bonfire.
                        They don't find much, save for a set of smaller arms
                        and 9 corpses, with 4 having tattoos indicating their
                        affiliation with the Red Sinkers, and 5 without. <br><br>

                        Following this discovery, Dante attempts to leave in his
                        car with Josie and her father. They are initially stopped
                        by a cop who tells them about the road ahead, and then go
                        forward. They are then set upon by what can only be
                        described as a large, quick, and hairy mass that continually
                        chases them until the end right back up in town. <br><br>

                        At this point, Rico is wandering around the woods and finds
                        a pack of Newmoor cigarettes. It's later discovered that this
                        particular brand appears to have been created in the future.

                        Desperate for more clues about the circumstances of the town,
                        James gets together with Dante, Josie, and Rico to explore
                        the mansion from yesterday. The cops mysteriously warn a gas
                        leak, cryptically citing the chemical name for mustard gas
                        as a warning for not going towards the mansion following
                        its destruction. <br><br>

                        Dante pulls up with James, and they have an idea to listen
                        to the police channel. They briefly hear a horrifying scene,
                        and then hear the police literally saying the words "chatter..." <br><br>

                        They approach the tower, finding a hole near the base. This
                        hole seems to house an invisible item after further inspection.
                        James discovers the tower went out around 12:08 AM on January 1st. <br><br>

                        After retreating from the warped tower, the gang finds a
                        mysterious man (spotted first by Dante yesterday) playing
                        with the hideous mass from Dante's drive earlier this day.
                        With Ashe playing with Shaggy, the gang attempts to sneak
                        towards the car, and luckily get in without too much issue. <br><br>

                        Unfortunately, getting away from the insane duo was much more
                        of a chore. Dante eventually loses Shaggy, and the gang get
                        to a checkpoint with police, where they are inspecting everyone's
                        cars.

                        When Dante attempts to hide his orb in the engine, it's sniffed
                        out by a dog, where the police confront him, obviously seeking
                        this very item via the establishment of this checkpoint.
                        Fast-talking the cops, Dante manages to grab the orb while
                        everyone else sneaks back into the car. The session ends
                        with Dante stepping on the gas.
