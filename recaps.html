            Mobsters in North Mills
          </h2>
          <p>
            The story starts in the fictional town, North Mills, Kentucky.
            It's a couple of days before new years, specifically the year
            2000. One Marian James is hosting a new years party for many
            of their friends. The notable among these are our player
            characters, namely Dante, James, Josie, and Rico. <br><br>

            The party is being held at an irish pub, O'Galliger's.
            (i forgor the rest of the session in detail...)

          <h2>
            A Company called Vericide
          </h2>
          <p>
              Following the events of their introduction to North Mill,
              the party goes to leave in their respective vehicles,
              but finds all of their cars (except for Dante's) sabotaged
              in an odd way: most are filled with some sort of slime! <br><br>

              Meanwhile, Rico follows a trail of blood from the street
              into the forest, find a severed hand. He discovers a watch
              engraved with the letters "NMPO" on it, later being revealed
              to mean North Mill Police Officer; it appeared to have
              belonged to one Luke Meadows, a Traffic Cop officer. <br><br>

              Following this discovery, a visit to the police station
              reveals that this Luke Meadows is seemingly well and alive,
              to the mundane surprise of everyone. <br><br>

              With a critical success on a seemingly random Spot Hidden
              check, Rico spots one of the police officers tampering with
              a nearby motorcycle. Later inspection reveals a small amount
              of damage from an odd oozing substance. <br><br>

              The next morning, James wakes up early on a walk to find
              a good place to eat. He find a nice cafe to eat breakfast
              by himself at and then circles back around to meet Rico
              near yesterday's crime scene near O'Galliger's.
              With a critical success on a Spot Hidden check, Rico
              literally sniffs out a site of hooded figures burning
              corpses from a van out in the woods. He goes to tell
              James about how there were a few well-armed guards
              there as well. <br><br>

              Later, the entire gang gets together in order to
              investigate the now abandoned and smouldering bonfire.
              They don't find much, save for a set of smaller arms
              and 9 corpses, with 4 having tattoos indicating their
              affiliation with the Red Sinkers, and 5 without. <br><br>

              Following this discovery, Dante attempts to leave in his
              car with Josie and her father. They are initially stopped
              by a cop who tells them about the road ahead, and then go
              forward. They are then set upon by what can only be
              described as a large, quick, and hairy mass that continually
              chases them until the end right back up in town. <br><br>

              At this point, Rico is wandering around the woods and finds
              a pack of Newmoor cigarettes. It's later discovered that this
              particular brand appears to have been created in the future.

              Desperate for more clues about the circumstances of the town,
              James gets together with Dante, Josie, and Rico to explore
              the mansion from yesterday. The cops mysteriously warn a gas
              leak, cryptically citing the chemical name for mustard gas
              as a warning for not going towards the mansion following
              its destruction. <br><br>

              Dante pulls up with James, and they have an idea to listen
              to the police channel. They briefly hear a horrifying scene,
              and then hear the police literally saying the words "chatter..." <br><br>

              They approach the tower, finding a hole near the base. This
              hole seems to house an invisible item after further inspection.
              James discovers the tower went out around 12:08 AM on January 1st. <br><br>

              After retreating from the warped tower, the gang finds a
              mysterious man (spotted first by Dante yesterday) playing
              with the hideous mass from Dante's drive earlier this day.
              With Ashe playing with Shaggy, the gang attempts to sneak
              towards the car, and luckily get in without too much issue. <br><br>

              Unfortunately, getting away from the insane duo was much more
              of a chore. Dante eventually loses Shaggy, and the gang get
              to a checkpoint with police, where they are inspecting everyone's
              cars.

              When Dante attempts to hide his orb in the engine, it's sniffed
              out by a dog, where the police confront him, obviously seeking
              this very item via the establishment of this checkpoint.
              Fast-talking the cops, Dante manages to grab the orb while
              everyone else sneaks back into the car. The session ends
              with Dante stepping on the gas.

          <h2>
            Night in the Woods
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dante begins the session by driving through a police
            barrier with his car. He shortly gets a call from his boss.
            Rounding a corner, he barely grazes a family of four in
            a car, speeding ahead. <br><br>

            Rico then begins pulling out a map to help navigate, citing
            a cliff and a sharp right turn up ahead. The car eventually
            makes it to a fork in the road between two towns,
            Sloan's Valley and Greenwood. Dante chooses to turn to Greenwood. <br><br>

            A little bit later, the gang sees Ashe on the road. Dante runs
            them over without hesitation, dealing maximum damage.
            Then, Dante runs into wildfire, and the car unfortunately
            sustains enough damage to break down. <br><br>

            The dog then catches up with the party, as everyone scatters around
            to hide themselves. Mark, Josie's father, shoots at the beast,
            alerting it as he starts down the road. He is very quickly destroyed.
            Dante and James take this chance to repair the care a little more,
            where they use it to ram into the dog, killing it in a fireball. <br><br>

            Michael, Dante's friend, emerges from the ensuing explosion miraculously
            unharmed, thanks to the orb of sanctuary that he is carrying. Everyone
            attempts to recover from the insane sequence of events that had just happened. <br><br>

            Then, a pair of floating eyes approaches the party; these are the same eyes
            that had been previously spotted before several times. They reveals themselves
            in the form of a tall woman with an odd shopping cart, who calls herself
            the Shopkeep. Various transactions insue, consisting of money, sanity, and eldritch tomes. <br><br>

            As the entity disappears, a local politician, Rex Murphys, happens upon the gang.
            He offers to call over an ambulance for a very injured Dante, and gives a tent
            to help the others camp the night out, granting the party the first downtime in
            the campaign. <br><br>

            In this downtime, Rico and Josie do some firearm training, Dante gets some supplies
            from a connection, and James finds a good read in a cthulu mythos tome. <br><br>

            At the end of these three weeks, Josie stays out too long feeding a group of cats
            with Sabrina, and some "cops" from North Mills happen upon the two, attempting to
            take them out. Siobhan, the mobster responsible for almost blowing up the party
            in session one, makes a return, with a patchwork head. <br><br>

            After a messed up false tip for the cops, Dante and James go out into the forest.
            Josie and Sabrina fight off the cops, and meet up with Dante and James to find that
            Rico has been captured. They struggle follow the most obvious trail of beef jerky,
            but end up finding him being shoved into a police...limo? <br><br>

            The ensuing, indescribable car chase ends with a large amount of sanity loss for the party,
            Rico free, and Siobhan getting away. Sabrina catches a glimpse of the orb of sanctuary,
            and her demeanor changes significantly, where the session ends.

          <h2>
            Split Five Ways from Friday
          </h2>
          <p>
            To sum, this is the session where many "side quests" open up. <br><br>

            James needs to visit his office in New York, Rico needs to check in on his
            wife and daughter in the UK, Josie needs to help act for a script back in
            Hollywood, and Dante needs to help his sister out after a panicked phone 
            call. Consequently, the team decides to head to Fort Worth, where Dante's
            sister resides. <br><br>

            During their drive to Fort Worth via car, Dante and Rico have a heart-to-heart
            regarding their circumstances, but this is unfortunately cut short as a bump in
            the road causes the car to jolt and knock out Rico by hitting his head on the
            windshield. <br><br>

            When the party arrives to the house, Dante calls his sister, who picks up, but is
            being very quiet as she tries to avoid "movement" in her house. Walking into the house,
            James hears faint singing emanating from the kitchen, and sees an old woman. The rest
            of the gang heads upstairs to look for Dante's sister. <br><br>

            James inspects several models of cities around the house, viewing both
            Hollywood and New York City. The old woman heads upstairs and talks to
            the rest of the party, and very luckily, she belives they are movers. <br><br>

            The granddaughter does not believe this guise, however, and begins to call
            the police on the party. Meanwhile, Josie ends up in an odd dimension that
            she struggles to find her way out of. <br><br>

            When the cops arrive, their affiliation with the North Mills "police" becomes 
            immediately apparent, alongside the idea that the gang being summoned here
            was a setup of sorts. Even after finding their sister, Dante and his friends
            struggle to escape this house, eventually confronting a malicious spirit. <br><br>

            In the midst of this chaos Josie dies, James goes insane, and Rico is stricken with
            immediate grief. The party struggles, but eventually manages to deter the spirit
            from harming them further and manages to leave before more of the North Mills forces
            converge on the house, ending the session.

          <h2>
            No Eldritch Horrors in New York, Please!
          </h2>
          <p>
            A few hours after the previous encounter at the house, James drives to a local mall
            and gets food for the gang and begins reading his book as they shortly rest. He is
            very clearly insane. Rico comments on the urgency with which they have to approach
            the UK. <br><br>

            Josie is inexplicably reconstructed by an odd being originating form North Mills.
            She eventually comes into contact with Sabrina who is able to return Josie to her friends. <br><br>

            Dante drops off his sister to his parents as the party arrives at New York. Josie's ride
            arrives at New York, where she evades the scene before its other occupants pick up the attention
            of nearby cops. <br><br>

            Josie's wallet is stolen by a "phantom thief", who manages to escape the grasp of Merica A. Justice
            and James, unsurprisingly. Before the criminal escapes, James catches a glimpse of an ID card for
            an employee at Willburg Works, which is the rebranded version of a tech company that competes with
            the company that James works for. <br><br>

            James, Josie, and Dante get an "extreme" therapy session and restore some sanity, while Josie
            attempts to freeze her card at a bank. She runs into Sabrina, where she is given her cat back. <br><br>
