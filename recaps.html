            Mobsters in North Mill

          <p>
            The story starts in the fictional town, North Mill, Kentucky.
            It's a couple of days before new years, specifically the year
            2000. One Marian James is hosting a new years party for many
            of their friends. The notable among these are our player
            characters, namely Dante, James, Josie, and Rico. <br><br>

            The party is being held at an irish pub, O'Galliger's.
            (i forgor the rest of the session in detail...)

          <h2>
            Vericide Incorporates (formerly called "A company called Vericide")
          </h2>
          <p>
              Following the events of their introduction to North Mill,
              the party goes to leave in their respective vehicles,
              but finds all of their cars (except for Dante's) sabotaged
              in an odd way: most are filled with some sort of slime! <br><br>

              Meanwhile, Rico follows a trail of blood from the street
              into the forest, find a severed hand. He discovers a watch
              engraved with the letters "NMPO" on it, later being revealed
              to mean North Mill Police Officer; it appeared to have
              belonged to one Luke Meadows, a Traffic Cop officer. <br><br>

              Following this discovery, a visit to the police station
              reveals that this Luke Meadows is seemingly well and alive,
              to the mundane surprise of everyone. <br><br>

              With a critical success on a seemingly random Spot Hidden
              check, Rico spots one of the police officers tampering with
              a nearby motorcycle. Later inspection reveals a small amount
              of damage from an odd oozing substance. <br><br>

              The next morning, James wakes up early on a walk to find
              a good place to eat. He find a nice cafe to eat breakfast
              by himself at and then circles back around to meet Rico
              near yesterday's crime scene near O'Galliger's.
              With a critical success on a Spot Hidden check, Rico
              literally sniffs out a site of hooded figures burning
              corpses from a van out in the woods. He goes to tell
              James about how there were a few well-armed guards
              there as well. <br><br>

              Later, the entire gang gets together in order to
              investigate the now abandoned and smouldering bonfire.
              They don't find much, save for a set of smaller arms
              and 9 corpses, with 4 having tattoos indicating their
              affiliation with the Red Sinkers, and 5 without. <br><br>

              Following this discovery, Dante attempts to leave in his
              car with Josie and her father. They are initially stopped
              by a cop who tells them about the road ahead, and then go
              forward. They are then set upon by what can only be
              described as a large, quick, and hairy mass that continually
              chases them until the end right back up in town. <br><br>

              At this point, Rico is wandering around the woods and finds
              a pack of Newmore cigarettes. It's later discovered that this
              particular brand appears to have been created in the future.

              Desperate for more clues about the circumstances of the town,
              James gets together with Dante, Josie, and Rico to explore
              the mansion from yesterday. The cops mysteriously warn a gas
              leak, cryptically citing the chemical name for mustard gas
              as a warning for not going towards the mansion following
              its destruction. <br><br>

              Dante pulls up with James, and they have an idea to listen
              to the police channel. They briefly hear a horrifying scene,
              and then hear the police literally saying the words "chatter..." <br><br>

              They approach the tower, finding a hole near the base. This
              hole seems to house an invisible item after further inspection.
              James discovers the tower went out around 12:08 AM on January 1st. <br><br>

              After retreating from the warped tower, the gang finds a
              mysterious man (spotted first by Dante yesterday) playing
              with the hideous mass from Dante's drive earlier this day.
              With Ashe playing with Shaggy, the gang attempts to sneak
              towards the car, and luckily get in without too much issue. <br><br>

              Unfortunately, getting away from the insane duo was much more
              of a chore. Dante eventually loses Shaggy, and the gang get
              to a checkpoint with police, where they are inspecting everyone's
              cars.

              When Dante attempts to hide his orb in the engine, it's sniffed
              out by a dog, where the police confront him, obviously seeking
              this very item via the establishment of this checkpoint.
              Fast-talking the cops, Dante manages to grab the orb while
              everyone else sneaks back into the car. The session ends
              with Dante stepping on the gas.

          <h2>
            Night in the Woods
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dante begins the session by driving through a police
            barrier with his car. He shortly gets a call from his boss.
            Rounding a corner, he barely grazes a family of four in
            a car, speeding ahead. <br><br>

            Rico then begins pulling out a map to help navigate, citing
            a cliff and a sharp right turn up ahead. The car eventually
            makes it to a fork in the road between two towns,
            Sloan's Valley and Greenwood. Dante chooses to turn to Greenwood. <br><br>

            A little bit later, the gang sees Ashe on the road. Dante runs
            them over without hesitation, dealing maximum damage.
            Then, Dante runs into wildfire, and the car unfortunately
            sustains enough damage to break down. <br><br>

            The dog then catches up with the party, as everyone scatters around
            to hide themselves. Mark, Josie's father, shoots at the beast,
            alerting it as he starts down the road. He is very quickly destroyed.
            Dante and James take this chance to repair the care a little more,
            where they use it to ram into the dog, killing it in a fireball. <br><br>

            Michael, Dante's friend, emerges from the ensuing explosion miraculously
            unharmed, thanks to the orb of sanctuary that he is carrying. Everyone
            attempts to recover from the insane sequence of events that had just happened. <br><br>

            Then, a pair of floating eyes approaches the party; these are the same eyes
            that had been previously spotted before several times. They reveals themselves
            in the form of a tall woman with an odd shopping cart, who calls herself
            the shopkeeper. Various transactions insue, consisting of money, sanity, and eldritch tomes. <br><br>

            As the entity disappears, a local politician, Rex Murphys, happens upon the gang.
            He offers to call over an ambulance for a very injured Dante, and gives a tent
            to help the others camp the night out, granting the party the first downtime in
            the campaign. <br><br>

            In this downtime, Rico and Josie do some firearm training, Dante gets some supplies
            from a connection, and James finds a good read in a cthulu mythos tome. <br><br>

            At the end of these three weeks, Josie stays out too long feeding a group of cats
            with Sabrina, and some "cops" from North Mill happen upon the two, attempting to
            take them out. Siobhan, the mobster responsible for almost blowing up the party
            in session one, makes a return, with a patchwork head. <br><br>

            After a messed up false tip for the cops, Dante and James go out into the forest.
            Josie and Sabrina fight off the cops, and meet up with Dante and James to find that
            Rico has been captured. They struggle follow the most obvious trail of beef jerky,
            but end up finding him being shoved into a police...limo? <br><br>

            The ensuing, indescribable car chase ends with a large amount of sanity loss for the party,
            Rico free, and Siobhan getting away. Sabrina catches a glimpse of the orb of sanctuary,
            and her demeanor changes significantly, where the session ends.

          <h2>
            Split Five Ways from Friday
          </h2>
          <p>
            To sum, this is the session where many "side quests" open up. <br><br>

            James needs to visit his office in New York, Rico needs to check in on his
            wife and daughter in the UK, Josie needs to help act for a script back in
            Hollywood, and Dante needs to help his sister out after a panicked phone 
            call. Consequently, the team decides to head to Willow Park, where Dante's
            sister resides. <br><br>

            During their drive to Willow Park via car, Dante and Rico have a heart-to-heart
            regarding their circumstances, but this is unfortunately cut short as a bump in
            the road causes the car to jolt and knock out Rico by hitting his head on the
            windshield. <br><br>

            When the party arrives to the house, Dante calls his sister, who picks up, but is
            being very quiet as she tries to avoid "movement" in her house. Walking into the house,
            James hears faint singing emanating from the kitchen, and sees an old woman. The rest
            of the gang heads upstairs to look for Dante's sister. <br><br>

            James inspects several models of cities around the house, viewing both
            Hollywood and New York City. The old woman heads upstairs and talks to
            the rest of the party, and very luckily, she belives they are movers. <br><br>

            The granddaughter does not believe this guise, however, and begins to call
            the police on the party. Meanwhile, Josie ends up in an odd dimension that
            she struggles to find her way out of. <br><br>

            When the cops arrive, their affiliation with the North Mill "police" becomes 
            immediately apparent, alongside the idea that the gang being summoned here
            was a setup of sorts. Even after finding their sister, Dante and his friends
            struggle to escape this house, eventually confronting a malicious spirit. <br><br>

            In the midst of this chaos Josie dies, James goes insane, and Rico is stricken with
            immediate grief. The party struggles, but eventually manages to deter the spirit
            from harming them further and manages to leave before more of the North Mill forces
            converge on the house, ending the session.

          <h2>
            No Eldritch Horrors in New York, Please!
          </h2>
          <p>
            A few hours after the previous encounter at the house, James drives to a local mall
            and gets food for the gang and begins reading his book as they shortly rest. He is
            very clearly insane. Rico comments on the urgency with which they have to approach
            the UK. <br><br>

            Josie is inexplicably reconstructed by an odd being originating form North Mill.
            She eventually comes into contact with Sabrina who is able to return Josie to her friends. <br><br>

            Dante drops off his sister to his parents as the party arrives at New York. Josie's ride
            arrives at New York, where she evades the scene before its other occupants pick up the attention
            of nearby cops. <br><br>

            Josie's wallet is stolen by a "phantom thief", who manages to escape the grasp of Meric A. Justice
            and James, unsurprisingly. Before the criminal escapes, James catches a glimpse of an ID card for
            an employee at Willburg Works, which is the rebranded version of a tech company that competes with
            the company that James works for. <br><br>

            James, Josie, and Dante get an "extreme" therapy session and restore some sanity, while Josie
            attempts to freeze her card at a bank. She runs into Sabrina, where she is given her cat back. <br><br>

            Michael and Josie pull a Taylor Swift and use the plane to fly to another airport within New York
            in order to better access James' workplace. Unfortunately, they forget to fly with James and Dante
            on board.

            Meric A. Justice is called onto the scene of a suspicious character of the approximately same
            build of someone who robbed Josie. They're standing around at a very odd construction site for
            Willburg Works. Officer Justice and James crack down on the criminal, who attempts to flee as
            his identity is uncovered. He is stopped in his tracks by the police, luckily. <br><br>

            Meanwhile, Michael and Josie fly to Wells Falls, James' workplace, and commit breaking and entering.
            They find research over Karmic Demons, whose description fits that of the North Mill cops. In addition,
            they find a merger paper from Willburg Works proposing a merge with Wells Falls. <br><br>

            James is visited by Mr. Triangle, an individual whose ID was found in the Wells Falls building. He is
            informed that his parent company has merged with Willburg Works and his handed a new ID for this
            company. <br><br>

            As James goes down for "orientation", he avoids a giant enemy spider that attempts to kill him.
            Meeting back up with his friends, they are confronted by the spider and Mr. Triangle himself.
            In the ensuing fight, Mr. Triangle attempts to beat up the party, but he is quickly ended by
            several fumbles on top of the unfortunate case of being shot in the face by a shotgun and pistol. <br><br>

            And although the spider manages to down both Dante and James, Josie and Justice manage to destroy the spider
            before it uses a mind-controlled Dante and James to kill Josie. <br><br>

          <p>
            As the party begins session 6, Rico wakes up and finds Josie to be alive and... different.
            As the jet crosses the pond, most of the party gets sleep while James keeps reading his tome. <br><br>

            They land at the city of Mold and manage to take their weapons with them to the house of Rico's ex-wife,
            Reagan. There, she reports the appearance of several odd plants not native to the United Kingdom dating
            back to January sixth.

            After being told the name of the family who first reported a disappearance of their child a while back
            ever since the plants came about, Dante and Rico go to the family's house for questioning.
            After getting some information, they find that the orb in Dante's car has been stolen.
            Unfortunately for our investigators, their attempts to chase down this thief are fruitless as they get away. <br><br>

            They return back to Reagan's house, having some spaghetti as they discuss their findings over their meal.
            Out of these findings, they discuss how most of the people who've gone missing recently are political activists and
            university students. More notable are the bloodied lipstick found in the son of the notable family's room, and
            their apparent political affiliation. <br><br>

            Waking up the next morning, the gang finds the house they slept in to be covered in vines a lot more than usual,
            as if the house is being constricted. After much deliberation, the gang decides to go into the living maze
            within the backyard of Reagan's home. After a day within the maze, they find a clearing with several corpses
            mutilated by plantlife. <br><br>

            After shooting an odd plant statue in the clearing, Rico and his friends leave as they hear crying echoing
            throughout the forest. Just as they exit the maze, James realizes the voice belongs to Ruby, they child
            of Rico. It's very likely that a creature known as a Karmic Demon has disguised itself as Ruby. The party
            gets into their car to find Ruby, who has seem to have fled following this revelation. <br><br>

            As they make their way through the town, they eventually find Ruby, who is revealed to not be a Karmic
            Demon, but is also working for Vericide. They retreat with Sabrina as they summon a massive plant-monster
            to keep the investigators occupied. After they defeat the monster, Dante and James realize that they
            left Michael behind with the orb. They successfully are able to flee from a Vericide helicopter and
            flee with the orb in hand. <br><br>

            The session starts in the Great Britain Hotel. This session marks the end of the "tutorial section"
            of the game. As a mysterious result from the night before, most of the party has had their memories wiped
            James had handed off the orb to a mysterious man after they had fled Vericide, and only James and Rico
            remember anything about the orb. <br><br>

            Starting from January 29th, the gang decides to take a lot of down time in order to improve their skills
            and do things on their todo list for three months. <br><br>

            James spends 4 weeks reading the mythos tome. He visits the shopkeeper, giving him the Telepathic trait.
            This allows him to telepathically communicate with creatures within 60 feet, and he is able to increase
            his intelligence by 5. In exchange, he loses a significant amount of electronics and mathematics skills. <br><br>

            In the meantime, Josie reports back to her mother and reports the untimely death of her father. After
            initially appearing to take the news seriously, her mother then immediately goes to make funeral preparations
            in a very unserious way. <br><br>

            Dante, James, and Josie are contacted by Sabrina in their dreams, who asks them to meet at Central Park at 6AM.
            After meeting there, they take drugs to prevent them from going insane and proceed to meet an alien that tells
            them about how they intercepted a signal from terrorists and wanted help to put a stop to them. Ashe also
            joins in and together they go into a doorway to Afghanistan. <br><br>

            Ashe talks about how they let a powerful creature get away into the area, and that they need to catch it.
            They see a massive purple orb in the middle of the desert, and as they walk into each party member seems
            to (temporarily) change form. <br><br>

            Stepping into the bubble, they release that anything said comedically or ironically may or may not happen.
            James joking says "It's not like they're going to rise out of the sand and greet us" in response to Josie
            asking the locals about where the terrorists could be located. <br><br>

            After a while of wandering the party makes their way into a basement of sorts. Making their way through
            several traps, they find themselves in a hall, where at the end of it there's... Terrorist Kermit?
            (genuinely, this is such an awful session. Why.) <br><br>

            After miraculously defeating evil kermit through the use of Dante's firearm skills, the party finally
            comes across the creature that they need to find. Although Ashe manages to shoot several tranquilizer
            darts into it, the enraged creature begins casting D&D spells at random. James almost dies to a delayed
            blast fireball while Dante and Josie get trapped in a demiplane. <br><br>

            After this entire debacle, everyone in the party miraculously makes it out alive. Ashe and the alien
            part ways, and Ashe's stunt double that excels at driving challenges Dante to drive to James' research
            building. Dante is beaten by a single second. The party takes a tour around the relatively empty
            building, where the session ends.

            The session opens with Rico having a conversation with his ex-wife about Ruby.
            He spends his nine weeks training his firearms, spotting, and tracking.
            As he prepares to contact some old friends of Ruby, he has a dream about his
            business days. One of the clients catches his attention, Sabrina. She asks Rico
            for help with something, to which he unpolitely declines. <br><br>

            Josie attempts to call Rico, but is unable to. However, she does find an odd
            phonebook left behind by the shopkeeper, where she is able to contact Rico.
            They agree to meet up at James' research warehouse. Josie begins looking into
            the phonebook more and finds pictures and other odd graphics for many people
            that the party has met. <br><br>

            As Dante is assembling the last of his card tower, Rico knocks it down.
            After explaining that they went to Afghanistan, Rico briefly loses it
            before calming down. "Josie you're grounded. You two suck."
            James questions the shopkeeper about some of the terminology being
            thrown around by Vericide affiliates, such as "Dimension Door"
            and "Demiplane," and confirms the legitimacy of his current hunch. <br><br>

            Josie gets a call from her mother to head over and bring some craft-service
            workers over with her to help out with a movie they're filming. Dante gives
            a call to his boss to let them know he'll be out. James runs into Rico who's
            in the filing closet as he is putting away files. <br><br>

            The party arrives at the island on April 7th, 2000. This session is a whole
            bunch of references to the last campaign played by everyone in the group
            (except for me) called Revelation. The movie set on this island
            is being directing by Frank Kings, a notably annoying studio executive. <br><br>

            It then comes to the attention of everybody that a fire is happening at a building.
            Without hesitation, James and Dante rush into to save a burning person. While Dante
            is carrying them out, James mistakenly throws water onto the person, and they
            ignite further and burn to death, as they had experienced an oil fire. James is
            inconsolable and runs off as he tries to get a grip on what he just did. <br><br>

            Dante finds an odd gauntlet that's warm to the touch, and Josie is lowered into
            a hole that's near the crime scene. She hears faint singing and finds some goo
            at the bottom of the pit. Rico, Dante, and Josie go elsewhere to find James. <br><br>

            Dante gets lost in the forest, and finds a backpack with transcripts of interviews on
            the island. The two people conducting these interviews appear to not exist. Dante
            eventually meets back up with Josie and Rico, who have found James and get him
            to examine the gauntlet. James states that the gauntlet is cobbled together.
            Whoever assembled it is not proficient in the construction of such devices. <br><br>

            James attempts to cast detect thoughts and utterly fails. The party questions the light
            and audio engineers on-site, and don't discover much. James utterly fails again on
            a check to calm down the distressed audio engineer. Dante follows her to the sound
            studio as she flees from the scene. <br><br>

            The entire party gets a random gash across their bodies, a purse appears, and
            a random hole appears in the ground and starts playing music in a foreign tongue.
            Do with that what you will. <br><br>

            As a more personal note for this instance, <br><br>

            [EXPUNGED] <br><br>

            The next day, the gang heads over to the sound engineer's building
            and discovers that part of their memories have been erased. It
            appears that the holes generating sound cause this supposed memory loss. <br><br>

            Rico and his friends walk into a tent and shoots a man who threatens him,
            and they figure out that this man was the murderer. <br><br>

            The session begins with the members deciding to enter a cave on the island.
            Despite James' protests, they all agree to enter regardless of a bad feeling
            they get. Upon entering the cave, everything goes black and they wake up
            in the medical bay. <br><br>

            Upon returning where the cave was, they find a solid wall.
            Then, James looks up and, for some reason, stares directly at the
            sun and burns his eyes, much like the many people told not to look
            at a recent eclipse who looked at it anyway. After talking around,
            it's discovered that Audrey went missing a few days ago. <br><br>

            When they examine the burned building, there is no sign of any person's
            death, and they're approached by one of Amastacia's bodyguards named
            Rio. He talks about happening across Dante and James as odd, and politely
            asks for information regarding odd happenings at the island. After exchanging
            information, Rico turns the corner and talks to Rio. <br><br>

            Then, the party decides to visit Claude. After hearing his robotic responses,
            James attempts to jailbreak him; Claude subsequently pops out of existence
            and everyone forgets about him, most especially everyone else on the island.
            The party has memory of him existing, but everyone else doesn't even know
            about him. <br><br>

            After James talks to Mr. Amastacia, he goes to return back to his friends,
            but is stopped by a large man, who tells him to come with them. He follows
            them. Meanwhile, Rico, Dante, and Josie ask Mr. Amastacia where James went
            and he simply states that James decided "to go for a walk on the beach." <br><br>

            James wakes up in a cave wearing earplugs; his friends discovered that they
            could break the illusion by plugging their ears. They discovered the entrance
            to the cave and managed to find Audrey. The entire island is surrounded by
            horrifying hydra heads. Delving deeper into the cave, they confront the
            hydra. Right before they almost die, a team of odd-looking characters,
            who aren't quite from this universe, emerges and manages to take
            down the false hydra. <br><br>

            After getting outside, Rex Murphys arrives on a United States cruiser
            at the beach and makes contact with the survivors of this incident,
            and James gives him his business card, and then Rex Murphys sends them
            off in a helicopter to New York City. <br><br>
